# html-css-express

A simple template for websites made in HTML and CSS, with an Express.js back-end serving a public folder.

## Installation & Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

After this, you're all set. Modify index.html to change the website. If you want to use SCSS, make sure you have a file watcher set-up to convert style.scss to style.css.

Happy website building!
