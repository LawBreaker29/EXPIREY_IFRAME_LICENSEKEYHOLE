# html-css-express

A simple template for websites made in HTML and CSS, with an Express.js back-end serving a public folder.

## Installation & Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

After this, you're all set. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view your website. Modify index.html to change the website. If you want to use SCSS, make sure you have a file watcher set-up to convert style.scss to style.css.

## Deployment

You can use this configuration to deploy to Heroku or any other cloud provider. If you wish to use Heroku, simply make an app and follow the steps on their end to host, the app should be fully compatible with this template. Feel free to write me a message if you are facing issues.

Happy website building!
